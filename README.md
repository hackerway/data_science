Data Science

This class is about learning from data, in order to gain useful predictions and insights. Separating signal from noise presents many computational and inferential challenges, which we approach from a perspective at the interface of computer science and statistics.  Through real-world examples of wide interest, we introduce methods for five key facets of an investigation:
 
1. Data munging/scraping/sampling/cleaning in order to get an informative, manageable data set;
2. Data storage and management in order to be able to access data - especially big data - quickly and reliably during subsequent analysis;
3. Exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition about the data;
4. Prediction based on statistical tools such as regression, classification, and clustering; and communication of results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.
